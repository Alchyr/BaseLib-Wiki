BaseLib contains a few utilities to help with the creation of and increase the variety of options available to use for creature visuals. This page will explain those as well as some more general information regarding creating creature visuals.

## NCreatureVisuals

This is the script (effectively the base type) that all creature visuals must be. However, when creating a scene through Godot's editor, scripts from other assemblies are not accessible. There are a few options to work around this.

* Define a class inheriting from `NCreatureVisuals` marked with the `[GlobalClass]` attribute and use it as the script for your scene. You can add additional functionality in this class as well if you wish.
* Use `NodeFactory<NCreatureVisuals>.CreateFromScene` to convert a scene that isn't using `NCreatureVisuals` as its script into an `NCreatureVisuals` instance. `CustomCharacterModel` will do this by default if the scene path provided for its visuals does not inherit from NCreatureVisuals.
* Use `NodeFactory<NCreatureVisuals>.CreateFromResource` to convert a `.png` or other common image format into an `NCreatureVisuals` instance. If using this for a character, override `CreateCustomVisuals` and return this.
* Define the visuals scene manually by editing a .tscn file in text, which allows you to set its script to NCreatureVisuals. You will not be able to edit this scene in the Godot editor.

## Scene Setup

An `NCreatureVisuals` follows a specific setup and has required named nodes. If you create a class inheriting `NCreatureVisuals` and use it as the script, you will need to match this setup exactly.

The root node should be a Control, with the following children.

| Name              | Unique Name | Details                                                                                                    | Optional |
|-------------------|:-----------:|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|:--------:|
| Visuals           |     Yes     | Any Node2D. Should contain all visuals.                                                                    |    No    |
| PhobiaModeVisuals |     Yes     | Any Node2D. Alternative visuals if phobia mode is enabled.                                                 |    Yes   |
| Bounds            |     Yes     | Control. Hitbox size.                                                                                      |    No    |
| IntentPosition    |     Yes     | Marker2D. Position of intent, usually around top of bounds.                                                |    No    |
| CenterPos         |     Yes     | Marker2D. Used as vfx spawn position. Should be approximately at visual center of character.               |    No    |
| OrbPos            |     Yes     | Marker2D. Central point of orbs, generally similar to intent position. If not provided, IntentPos is used. |    Yes   |
| TalkPos           |     Yes     | Marker2D. Origin of speech bubbles. If not provided an approximate position is chosen based on Bounds.     |    Yes   |

If your scene is converted by `NodeFactory` the requirements are slightly different. Only the `Visuals` node is required, but also including the `Bounds` node is strongly recommended. The other positions will be automatically determined based on `Bounds` if not provided.

## From Static Image

```c#
    public override NCreatureVisuals? CreateCustomVisuals()
    {
        return NodeFactory<NCreatureVisuals>.CreateFromResource("res://Path/To/Your/Image.png");
    }
```

This will first create a basic `NCreatureVisuals` node with a `Visuals` node containing the provided resource as a `Texture2D`, and a `Bounds` node using the size of the image. This will then be passed to the "from scene" factory to add the other necessary nodes.
